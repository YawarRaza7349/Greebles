# Greebles
This was an early assignment for my Data Visualization class, focusing on the visualization part (the greebles are not data-driven). The term "greeble", as used here, means one of those graphical widgets you'd find on a user interface of a science fiction movie or TV series (which are meant to look cool, rather than be the best way to display information to the user). This application shows a number of such widgets scattered on the screen, animating over time. The code is written in CoffeeScript, using Processing.js as a graphical library, and using Underscore.js as a utilities library. I have only uploaded the CoffeeScript source code here; if you'd like to see the working application, [here](https://jsfiddle.net/zycgwb0p/embedded/result/) is a JSFiddle that takes care of including dependencies. You can refresh the page to see a new arrangement of widgets each time.
